# Musical Time Machine (Spotify playlist of Billboard top 100 songs on a selected date)


This project is the Day-46 project from the Udemy online course: [100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Aangela Yu.

### The end result of the code

### Next step
Now I am not that familiar with the oauth thing, and not sure if I could make any user to log-in spotify to run my app and make a playlist.

I will keep working on this project and maybe build a simple front-end page to interact with users (or use replit to do this).
